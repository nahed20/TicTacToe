 Welcome to Tic Tac Toe , This is a simple game that I created with javascript/jquery/html/css skills. Most of the games I have seen online require two players, I  tried to creating a game where one player plays .</br>
</br>
**project Steps:**
1-set the player o or x .</br>
2-allow human whether to play as x or o .</br>
3-display message for winner .</br>
4-Button to reset game .</br>
</br>
**How to play ??**</br>
When the game is loaded , the player click on cell to start play here the user will start with x then o ,by getting three in a row - either across, down, or diagonal.
in case of non player win the reset button will restart game .</br>
