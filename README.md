1-set the player o or x .</br>
2-allow human whether to play as x or o .</br>
3-display message for winner .</br>
4-Button to reset game .</br>
</br>
**How to play ??**</br>
When the game is loaded , the player click on cell to start play here the user will start with x then o ,by getting three in a row - either across, down, or diagonal.
in case of non player win the reset button will restart game .</br>
