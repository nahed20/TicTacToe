built by Nahed Hawsawi 

![alt text](project_1.PNG)

Welcome to Tic Tac Toe , This is a simple game that I created with javascript/jquery/html/css skills. Most of the games I have seen online require two players, I  tried to creating a game where one player plays .

1-set the player o or x .
2-allow human whether to play as x or o .
3-display message for winner .
4-Button to reset game .

How to play ??
When the game is loaded , the player click on cell to start play here the user will start with x then o ,by getting three in a row - either across, down, or diagonal.
in case of non player win the reset button will restart game .

Technology and Tooles used:
HTML 
CSS
JavaScript  
Jquary         

Further improvements:
1-Keep track of multiple game rounds with a win counter .
2-Allow players to customize their tokens ( name, picture, etc).
3-Support networked multiplayer .
4-Landing page with animtion effect ,emoji to the game display the winner .
